  As a potential purchaser
  I want to view the about page

  Scenario: Happy Path
    When I go to the home page
    And I click on "About"
    Then I should see "My name is Lindsay. I live in the South where I write, make music, make homes and make friends. I have two rescue pugs named Nora and Manny and we all live in a 1910 house. Older is always better, in my opinion, and you will usually find me scouring Craigslist and/or the backwoods in search of treasures to restore. Encore Furnishings is my furniture restoration, painting and staining service in Nashville, TN."
